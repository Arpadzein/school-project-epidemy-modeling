# Epidemy modeling school project
This is a project I made years ago to simulate an epidemy. The code is dirty, and I have no intent to clean it, at least not in this repo with the CamlLight version. I might one day translate it to C++.

The python file is just a numeric modeling based on elementary differential equations.
